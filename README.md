# satoshi
You have a list of your friends, you tap them to send them a satoshi (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin).

Satoshi. It's that simple.

# Development

This is the client repo, see also [React Native's Readme](REACT_NATIVE.md).
It talks to the [Satoshi server](https://github.com/ripper234/satoshi-api).

To get started, do

```
(setup Satoshi Server first)
npm install
npm start
```

In order to run the app locally, replace `localAddress`(in `/config.dev.js`) with your local IP.
